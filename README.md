# Evaluation of Sense Embeddings with Optimized Vector-Meaning Correspondence
Lemon: fruit🍋 or color🟡? Evaluating how well sense embeddings, including from LLMs, capture meaning differences. How well does the embedding represent multi-sense (polysemy) words?

Our novel evaluation method reveals what meanings do sense embeddings have by deciphering which vector corresponds to which meaning based on neighboring words.
